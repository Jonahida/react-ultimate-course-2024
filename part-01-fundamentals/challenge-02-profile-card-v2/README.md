### Code Update

- The code now uses an array skills to store skill data, allowing for easier management and rendering of skills.

### UI Changes

- Skills are now displayed with a background color based on the color prop from the skills array.
- Each skill level is represented by an emoji (üí™ for advanced, üëç for intermediate, üë∂ for basic).
