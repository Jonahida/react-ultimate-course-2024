# JavaScript Review

## Book Data and Functions

The code defines an array `data` containing information about several books. Each book object includes properties such as `id`, `title`, `publicationDate`, `author`, `genres`, `hasMovieAdaptation`, `pages`, `translations`, and `reviews`. Two functions, `getBooks()` and `getBook(id)`, are provided to retrieve all books or a specific book by its ID from the `data` array.

## Concepts Covered

### 18. Destructuring Objects and Arrays

Demonstrates destructuring syntax to extract specific properties from book objects.

### 19. Rest/Spread Operator

Shows the use of the spread operator (`...`) to create copies of arrays and objects, and the rest parameter (`...`) to collect remaining elements into arrays.

### 20. Template Literals

Illustrates the use of template literals (enclosed in backticks `` ` ``) for creating formatted strings with embedded expressions.

### 21. Ternaries Instead of if/else Statements

Uses ternary operators (`condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse`) as concise alternatives to if/else statements.

### 22. Arrow Functions

Introduces arrow functions (`(params) => expression`) for concise function definitions, especially useful for inline functions.

### 23. Short-Circuiting And Logical Operators: &&, ||, ??

Demonstrates logical operators (`&&`, `||`) for conditional expressions and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for fallback values.

### 24. Optional Chaining

Illustrates optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access deeply nested properties without causing errors.

### 25. The Array map Method

Uses the `map()` method to transform arrays by applying a function to each element.

### 26. The Array filter Method

Utilizes the `filter()` method to create a new array containing elements that pass a specified condition.

### 27. The Array reduce Method

Shows the `reduce()` method to reduce an array to a single value (e.g., summing up pages of all books).

### 28. The Array sort Method

Demonstrates the `sort()` method to arrange array elements based on a sorting criterion (e.g., sorting books by pages).

### 29. Working With Immutable Arrays

Illustrates how to add, remove, and update elements in arrays without mutating the original array using spread syntax and functional programming techniques.

### 30. Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises

Uses promises and `fetch()` API to asynchronously fetch data from a remote server and handle responses.

### 31. Asynchronous JavaScript: Async/Await

Introduces async functions and `await` keyword for asynchronous operations, making asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to read.
